# About me

I am Senior Infrastructure Engineer working in a Managed Service Provider setting. 
I specialise in Microsoft, Citrix and VMware technologies.
In the last two years I have been focused on Microsoft Azure working in an Agile squad.

As I continue transition from Infrastructure Engineer to DevOps Engineer I'll share my on the job learnings through regular posts. 

I am a strong advocate of vendor certifications paths, without them you quite often don't know what you don't know. I'll share my study material as I go.
