# About me

I am Senior Infrastructure Engineer working in a Managed Service Provider setting. 
I specialise in Microsoft, Citrix and VMware technologies.
In the last two years I have been focused on Microsoft Azure working in an Agile squad.

As I transition from 3rd Line IT Engineer to DevOps Engineer I will provide concise posts to share my on the job learnings. 

I am a strong advocate for vendor certifications paths, without them you quite often don't know what you don't know. I will upload any study material to help others.
