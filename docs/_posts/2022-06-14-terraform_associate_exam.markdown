# Exam Experience
- You have to create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) user account so that you may authenticate with the online exam provider [psi exams](https://identity.psionline.com/samlsso?spEntityID=https://home.psiexams.com/callback&fidp=hashicorp) - more information may be found [here](https://hashicorp-certifications.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049382552).
- Do not use your builtin laptop camera (if possible), otherwise you will find you are twizzling your laptop round attempting to capture your room dimensions perfectly within 15 seconds - very frustrating.
- The Course below covered 95% of the content needed for the exam. I highly recommend, you will need to persevere through the content on variables but otherwise great course.
- I also attended a free [HashiCorp Terraform Cloud Workshop](https://www.hashicorp.com/events?type=all) event that provided free access to a Terraform Cloud Lab environment for 7 days - this was useful content for the exam.
- The Practice questions referenced below are a good representation of the real questions - very good practice once you have finished your studies.
- My study was orientated around Azure rather than AWS and I found this didn't affect my performance in the exam - it was mostly Cloud Service Provider neutral and any nuisances that may be tested were covered largerly by the Practice Exam questions.
